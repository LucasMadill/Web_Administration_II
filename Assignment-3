*/ Question 1: Create and test an HTML document that describes nested ordered lists of cars. The outer list must have three 
entries: compact, midsize, and sports. Inside each of these three lists, there must be two sublists of body styles. The 
compact- and midsize-car sublists are two-door and four-door; the sports-car sublists are coupe and convertible. Each body-style
sublist must have at least three entries, each of which is the make and model of a particular car that fits the category. The 
outer list must use uppercase Roman numerals, the middle lists must use uppercase letters, and the inner lists must use Arabic 
numerals. The background color for the compact-car list must be pink; for the midsize-car list, it must be blue; for the 
sports-car list, it must be red. All the styles must be in a document style sheet. (30 points) */
