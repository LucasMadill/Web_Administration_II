				<h1>The paragon called Discernment</h1>
				<p style="color:white">There once was a craftsman of unparallel strength and wisdom. His understanding of the power of words could invoke a paradise of precise clarity or a hell of forever torment. Yet, he saw the void bathed in formless darkness like an empty black canvas begging to be filled and he was filled with compassion. Long did he look into the abyss contemplating the consequences of his actions. The being knew that a single stroke upon the vastness of that deep would have far reaching consequences. Good friends would be won and last based upon their volition. The words once given form and conscious would react as they had been made and could not be unmade without great difficult. For a millennium, did he ponder the deep. "Very well", he said, "The cost is less than the harvest." "I must write the story of love, hope, faith, and redemption." In that moment, he whispered a detailed plan to redeem those that choose to follow discernment.</p>

				<h2>What is right is complex.</h2>
				<p>We wish <strong>fervently</strong> for it to be <b>simple</b> and that <i>light</i> will <small>always</small> conquer. That darkness will always lose, but that is not the way of beings of volition or of those with the knowledge of good and evil. How can one be good if it never had the option to be evil? This is a farse Discernment could not write into his creation for that framework would have made the victory a sham, an illusion, a victory not worth having.</p>
