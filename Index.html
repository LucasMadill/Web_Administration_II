			<h1>The paragon called Discernment</h1>
			<p style="color:blue">There once was a craftsman of unparallel strength and wisdom. His understanding of the power of words could invoke a paradise of precise clarity or a hell of forever torment. Yet, he saw the void bathed in formless darkness like an empty black canvas begging to be filled and he was filled with compassion. Long did he look into the abyss contemplating the consequences of his actions. The being knew that a single stroke upon the vastness of that deep would have far reaching consequences. Good friends would be won and last based upon their volition. The words once given form and conscious would react as they had been made and could not be unmade without great difficult. For a millennium, did he ponder the deep. "Very well", he said, "The cost is less than the harvest." "I must write the story of love, hope, faith, and redemption." In that moment, he whispered a detailed plan to redeem those that choose to follow discernment.</p>

			<h2>What is right is complex.</h2>
			<p>We wish <strong>fervently</strong> for it to be <b>simple</b> and that <i>light</i> will <small>always</small> conquer. That darkness will always lose, but that is not the way of beings of volition or of those with the knowledge of good and evil. How can one be good if it never had the option to be evil? This is a farse Discernment could not write into his creation for that framework would have made the victory a sham, an illusion, a victory not worth having.</p>

			<h2>Will they stay lost?</h2>
			<p style="color:purple">The volition will not be taken from them. Have you not experienced a friend who will stay his course into darkness and destruction? Can you not imagine a loss of a good friend never to be redeemed? With a being like compulsion this is impossible; and yet, with a being like Discernment all things are possible. Remember their was rules written in the dark before the light was commanded to shine. There is a power working silently in the background to bring all prodigical children home.</p>

			<h1>The renegade called Compulsion</h1>
			<h2>Question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of Discernment and Compulsion?</h2>
			<p style="color:yellowgreen">What of the conflict we find ourselves but pawns upon a vast board? What of that being of compulsion?</p>
			<h2>Answer: It is simply a volition.</h2>
			<p style="color:forestgreen">He had the choice to do what was right or wrong. For volition of the being of light and clay will not be infringed or impeded upon.</p>
			<h2>Explaination: A collar of obedience and devotion to the parent</h2>
			<h3>Theme: Adele "Rolling In The Deep"</h3>
			<p style="color:darkblue">Now there was one among them that wished his place would be secured and so he advocated for to attach a collar to always maintain a caste system. The discussion was great and yet as we all know cracks in foundations will lead to complete collapse of the structure over time. Discernment knew this to be true for his vision was great and his heart heavy with sorrow. He procceed without completely unity and the being wishing the collar silently in the dark became a force of compulsion. Silently it seethed, "I'm gonna make your head burn." A single discordant note rang out and an alternate tune silently began to vibrate. Harmony was every so slightly broken.</p>
